# Decal Scheduler
Schedule decals to be uploaded at a specified time

# requirements
+ Noblox.js installed  -----------> https://noblox.js.org/
+ Prompt-Sync installed ----------> https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-sync
+ Node js installed -----------> https://nodejs.org/en/
+ A good code editor like vscode or repl.it ---------> https://code.visualstudio.com/ , ---------> https://replit.com/
+ And finaly you must have an alt acc. dont use your main Acc it can get banned. [if doing bypasses]

# How it works
The script uses a simple setTimeout to specify the time. say you wanted to upload at 9pm, and its 5 pm, you just convert 4 hours to miliseconds and it will upload in 4 hours.

MAKE SURE THE FINAL IMAGE IS IN THE SAME DIRECTORY OF THE INDEX.JS OR IT WILL NOT UPLOAD!!!

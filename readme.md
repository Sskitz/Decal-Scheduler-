# Decal Scheduler
Schedule decals to be uploaded at a specified time

# requirements
+ Noblox.js installed
+ Prompt-Sync installed
+ Node js installed
+ And finaly you must have an alt acc. dont use your main Acc it can get banned. [if doing bypasses]

# How it works
The script uses a simple setTimeout to specify the time. say you wanted to upload at 9pm, and its 5 pm, you just convert 4 hours to miliseconds and it will upload in 4 hours.

+ I am not responsible for your actions, if you get banned do not come to me and complain. thats on you.
